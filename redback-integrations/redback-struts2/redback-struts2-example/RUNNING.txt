Running the Redback Security Example Webapp
------------------------------------------

To run, open a command prompt/terminal.

1)  Change directory to the Redback Security Example Webapp.

2)  Run the following Maven command line.

    >  mvn jetty:run-war

    This is ensure that the requisite resources are overlaid for example webapp
    before it is deployed to a Jetty instance.

    jetty:run-war will also run the unit tests for the example webapp. You can
    skip them like so:

    > mvn jetty:run-war -Dmaven.test.skip

    Or tomcat maven plugin
    mvn tomcat:run
    and go to http://localhost:9090
